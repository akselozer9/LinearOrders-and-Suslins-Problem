## Abstract
We define both dense and separable linear orders. We state and prove
unique order-theoretic characterizations of both (R, <) and (Q, <) due to
Cantor. We describe Suslin’s Problem and give several equivalent statements. We then discuss Aronszajn Trees and their relation to Suslin Trees.
Finally we briefly touch on the independence of Suslin’s Problem from ZFC
and the possible existence of Suslin Lines/Trees.
